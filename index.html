			<h1>Pink Floyd - Comfortably Numb</h1>
			<p>Verse 1</p>
			<p>Hello (hello, hello)?<br>
				Is there anybody in there?<br>
				Just nod if you can hear me.<br>
				Is there anyone home?<br>
				Come on (come on, come on) now.<br>
				I hear you're feeling down.<br>
				Well, I can ease your pain<br>
				Get you on your feet again.<br>
				Relax (relax, relax).<br>
				I'll need some information first.<br>
				Just the basic facts.<br>
				Can you show me where it hurts?</p>
			<p>Chorus 1</p>
			<p>There is no pain you are receding
				A distant ship's smoke on the horizon.
				You are only coming through in waves.
				Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.
				When I was a child I had a fever.
				My hands felt just like two balloons.
				Now I've got that feeling once again
				I can't explain, you would not understand
				This is not how I am.
				I have become comfortably numb.
				(solo)
				I have become comfortably numb.</p>
