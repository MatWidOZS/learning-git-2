			<p>Verse 1</p>
			<p>Hello (hello, hello)?<br>
				Is there anybody in there?<br>
				Just nod if you can hear me.<br>
				Is there anyone home?<br>
				Come on (come on, come on) now.<br>
				I hear you're feeling down.<br>
				Well, I can ease your pain<br>
				Get you on your feet again.<br>
				Relax (relax, relax).<br>
